            4 Tier: Extensions	30<br><br>
            Extension 1: [2h] [10 pts] [Add another undo/redo functionality]: The deleting the last goody can be undone and redone on
            home page. This can be tested by adding a goody at any point and then undoing the action by clicking the "undo button.
            This could then be redone by clicking the "redo" button. The undo will bring it back the state before the deletion, and
            the redo will perform the deletion again.<br><br>

            Extension 2: [1a] [5 pts] [Style using a CSS feature not discussed in class]: Styling used that was not discussed can be seen in
            styling on the header and nav. In the header, I use display flex with a flex-wrap. This allowed me to then use
            "align-content: center" so that the page title is centered on the top of each page. In addition to this, I utilize
            "display:flex" again in the nav styling which allowed me to then use the "justify-content: space-evenly". This separated each
            of the page links equally across the nav section.<br><br>

            Extension 3: [2j] [10 pts] [Add fancier selection for goodies and/or baskets]: Goody and basket selection is
            fancier by having the images of the goodies and baskets being selectable. This allows the user to see what the
            options look like before they are added to the basket.<br><br>

            Extension 4: [3a] [5 pts] [Make 3+ more goodies and/or baskets available]: For this, I added 3 more possible egg
            selections. The picture sizes are a little wonky. Otherwise, they function the same as the blue and striped eggs.<br><br>

        <div> <!--List of CSS modifications made and information about each-->
            My CSS rules are located in www/CSS/index.css<br>
            My rules are listed bellow with a description next to those that are required for this project.<br>
            <br>

            This is used on the home page to format the buttons used for adding a goody or changing the basket<br>
            .add-buttons {<br>
            margin: 10px;<br>
            padding: 0;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is used on the home page to be a title above the button selection for adding a goody or changing the basket<br>
            .add-title {<br>
            font-size: 20px;<br>
            display: flex;<br>
            justify-content: center;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is used on the home page to make the starting images smaller for the button selection options<br>
            .add-image {<br>
            width: 58px;<br>
            height: 80px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is used on the home page to be containers for the buttons that add goodies to the basket and allow basket changes <br>
            .add-section {<br>
            display: inline-block;<br>
            margin-right: 30px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is used on the home page to be a container for the goodies added to the basket<br>
            .goodies {<br>
            width: 650px;<br>
            margin: 30px 0 0 30px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is used on the home page to move the basket image off the left side of the page<br>
            .basket {<br>
            margin-left: 30px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is used on the home page to evenly space the "none" options at the application load<br>
            .none {<br>
            min-width:100px;<br>
            display: inline-block;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is used to not have the "nones" at the project open to be on left screen edge.<br>
            .noneContainer {<br>
            margin-left: 60px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is changing all the pages colors to something other than white as required by formatting requirement #1<br>
            body {<br>
            background-color: beige;<br>
            margin: 0;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is the custom header on all pages as required by formatting requirement #2<br>
            header {<br>
            background-color: darkgray;<br>
            padding-bottom: 10px;<br>
            display: flex;<br>
            flex-direction: column;<br>
            align-content: center;<br>
            flex-wrap: wrap;<br>
            margin: -10px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is styling to the h1 tag so that they are in the middle of the page<br>
            h1 {<br>
            text-align: center;<br>
            margin-right: 90px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is the navigation styling that include the background color as required by formatting requirement #3<br>
            nav {<br>
            background-color: honeydew;<br>
            width: 100%;<br>
            display: flex;<br>
            justify-content: space-evenly;<br>
            border: black 2px solid;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            a {<br>
            font-size: 18px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is the custom link as required by formatting requirement #4. It will turn the text black of the link being hovered<br>
            over in the nav section.<br>
            a {<br>
            font-size: 20px;<br>
            color: darkblue;<br>
            }<br>
            a:hover {<br>
            color: black;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is the styling class that is applied to all pages that puts a border around the application content as
            required by formatting requirement #5<br>
            .content-border {<br>
            border: black 3px solid;<br>
            padding: 10px;<br>
            }<br>
            <br>

            This is the styling class applied to the Help Page headers that provides a font style change as required by
            formatting option #6. It will also align them to the left side of the page<br>
            .font-change {<br>
            font-family: cursive;<br>
            text-align: start;<br>
            }<br>
        </div>

        <p>
            Home Page:<br><br>
            The home page of this application is used to create a goody basket, and this can be done in a variety of ways.
            It can first be done by making a custom basket using the buttons with "Eggs", "Bunny", and "Baskets" above them (showing the respective images).
            When one of these buttons is clicked, it will add the goody to the basket bellow with "Current Basket" titled above it.
            Once a goody is added, it will need to be confirmed using the button that says "confirm". While there is an
            unconfirmed goody, the goody selection buttons will disappear until the most recent goody is confirmed. After a goody is confirmed,
            it will add a white egg as a placeholder for another goody, and another goody could then be added.<br><br>

            Another way to make an easter basket is by using one of the preconfigured options that are listed to the right of the custom basket changing options.
            After one of these options is selected, further goodies can be added using the goody and basket options.<br><br>

            Through any of the custom goodies added or preconfigured options discussed so far, the "undo" button can be clicked to take the basket back a state.
            There is no limit on how many times the user wants to undo. Conversely, by clicking the "redo" button, all the changes can be redone back to the
            state that the user desires.<br><br>

            The most recent goody can also be deleted from the basket by clicking the "Delete Last Goody" button. If a goody is confirmed,
            (there is a white egg after it), it will remove the white egg and the confirmed goody. If the goody is unconfirmed,
            it will remove the goody and replace it with a white egg since the goody before it is still confirmed. NOTE: I implemented
            delete into the undo/redo, so any delete can be undone and redone.<br><br>

            Once a basket is configured as desired, it can be saved as a txt file to the "uploads" folder by clicking the button that says "save" on the home page.
            This will save the html of the goodies and the basket to the file. It will then send back the name of the file saved (test.txt) back to the home page for
            it to reload the content and thus preserve it as it was before the save. However, the undo and redo states are not preserved through this.
            It is also important to note that "unconfirmed" goodies will not be preserved across this save. I do not consider this to be not
            preserving the state of the page since it's a requirement to not save "unconfirmed" goodies. ALso, this allows the user to
            see what was actually saved.<br><br>

            It is also important to note that the "reset" button next to the save button can be used to clear the file that has
            been loaded. This button is really only needed when the "loadFile" parameter is set in the URL since it wont be cleared
            when the page is refreshed. If the "loadFile" parameter isn't set in the URL, the normal refresh will clear the page, but the
            "reset" button will work as well.<br><br>

            <br>
            File Management Page:<br><br>
            This page will allow you to upload, download, and load a file. To upload a file, click the "Choose File" and choose a txt file with the proper html.
            This should only be two lines. One line that has the goodies html and another that has the basket html.Once a file is chosen,
            click the "upload" button to add it to the "uploads" directory.<br><br>

            Bellow the upload section is the current file section that will list all the txt files in the "uploads" directory.
            Next to each file listed is a "load" and "download" button. If the download is selected, it will download the file to the
            users downloads directory. If load is selected, it will redirect back to the home page and load in the save goodies and basket.<br><br>

            This load does not preserve the undo redo from when it was saved, but further goodies and basket changes can be made and those can then be
            undone and redone.<br><br>
